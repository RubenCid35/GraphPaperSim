# GraphPaperSim

## Description
The objective of this project is a advanced Data Analysis on Research Publications. Given a corpus of 30 papers, the papers have been grouped according to their topics and similarities; and a knowledge graph has been constructed from those relationships. Additionally, the knowledge graph has been enriched with metadata using sources like [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) and [OpenAire](https://explore.openaire.eu/).
